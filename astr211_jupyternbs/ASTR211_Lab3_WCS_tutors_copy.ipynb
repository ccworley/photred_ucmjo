    "# Creating a WCS solution\n",
    "\n",
    "WCS solutions (as explained in Lab2 Photometry) use astrometric methods to find the field of view and plate-scale by using sets of stars. Below are a few methods on how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "One common method is to use index files/software. The most common software is from https://astrometry.net/doc/readme.html. This allows you to use a terminal command to plate-solve (or python through a terminal). However, there are a few things to note:\n",
    "1. This can only be installed with Linux or Macosx, Windows would have to use a virtual machine.\n",
    "2. The index files to install take up to 150 GB of hard drive space - so typically they are not worth it for personal devices unless you build/reduce plenty of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command to run this looks like: \n",
    "    \"solve-field --no-plots --scale-units arcminwidth --scale-low {lower bound} --scale-high {upper bound} {filename}\"\n",
    "where the objects within the \"{}\" are to be input. If you do not know the field scale you can use a slower version of the command: \"solve-field --no-plots {filename}\". This will create a series of files, where the \".new\" are the new files with the wcs header.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be the recommended method for most users. Using the same software as above the website: https://nova.astrometry.net/upload uses an API to connect to the index files, meaning that no install is required. All one has to do is upload the reduced file and wait. While this is more time consuming, it will work across all devices and does not require a lot of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### !!! We will use this method for our reduction in later labs !!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a method to plate solve using the same software but using a python environment and your own API. This method will charge you for each plate-solve which makes it largely inefficient for large image reductions when software installation will be faster, can be multiprocessed, and free.\n"

Solving this exactly can be computationally slow (~15-30s per image), so often interpolation strategies are employed.\n",
